INSTALLATION
============
1. Clone this project to the root path of your application
2. Review migration.sql to fit your scenario. Then execute it over a local database with dummy emails.
3. Review listSync to fit your scenario.
4. Once you are happy with how it works, set up a crontab with the following line:

0 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/listSync.php >> /path/to/somewhere/to/keep/a/log/mailchimp.log

   The above will run the task every hour and append results to a log file
